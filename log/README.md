#### Author: Sarah Lindmar

## Description

I am interested in interning with a company that is using a MEAN stack. This app will help me keep track of my career development goals and also practice building an app using MongoDB, Express, Angular2, and NodeJS. This application is a todo list for prioritizing and organizing my tasks and goals to prepare for graduation and a career as a developer. More detailed steps for this project setup can be found in this [article](https://hackernoon.com/build-real-time-app-with-mean2-angular-cli-and-socket-io-cedf1dc02fec) by Dassi Orleando.
